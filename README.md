# NeuralStyleTransfer-Deep-Learning-Specialization
This repository is based on a project completed as part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by DeepLearning.AI.  

## Introduction

In this project, The concept of Neural Style Transfer is explored. This remarkable algorithm was introduced by Gatys et al. in their influential paper from 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

The project covers the following items:
- Implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm.
- Generate novel artistic images using the algorithm.
  
While many algorithms you've encountered optimize cost functions to obtain sets of parameter values, in Neural Style Transfer, you will optimize a cost function to generate pixel values.

Originally, this project was implemented using Keras. However, here we delve into an adapted PyTorch version, thoughtfully crafted by [furkanu](https://github.com/furkanu/deeplearning.ai-pytorch/tree/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Week%204/Neural%20Style%20Transfer%20(Done)).
